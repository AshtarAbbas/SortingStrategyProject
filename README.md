**Implementation of Strategy Pattern.**
This project demonstrates the Strategy Design Pattern using different sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort) in Java. The SortingContext class allows dynamic switching between sorting strategies at runtime, making the implementation flexible and extensible.
 - Implements the Strategy Design Pattern for sorting algorithms
 - Supports multiple sorting techniques: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
 - Uses SortingContext to switch strategies dynamically
 - Clean, modular, and scalable Java code
